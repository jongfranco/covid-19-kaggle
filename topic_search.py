# # In[ ]:





# # ## Results
# # According to the key sentences in 33 abstract that discuss the topic of public using masks, only one paper suggests that thereâ€™s not enough evidence to show that mask is useful.
# # There are 14 papers that suggest their results show using surgical mask during a pandemic is effective in reducing infection
# # 14 paper consider public individuals using masks are necessary in reducing risks of being infect, and these paper look at whether the public are willing to comply to the rules. (X papers are from  Hong Kong, based on the region of the first author)
# # 5 papers are not relevant to the topic
# # 
# # Conclusion:
# # government in some regions advocate using masks as a standard approach to reduce risk of infection, papers in these regions focus on whether people comply to the rules. When some government advocate that there is little evidence show that mask is effective in controlling the pandemic, nearly half of the academic papers from our search result either consider wearing masks as a standard practice that the public show comply, nearly half of the papers found evidence to support that wearing masks is effective in controlling the pandemic.

# # *  Not relevant to the question
